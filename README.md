# Flashbots
Get familiar with Flashbots. There is a lot of stuff in the same repository that can be utilized in salvaging tokens from wallets that are automatically sweeped. It is not easy if you don't have a lot of technical knowledge about smart contracts and working with scripting languages, but it's not impossible either. The general idea is to send the tokens from wallet that is being sweeped and fund that transaction with a different wallet that pays for the gas. These transactions have to happen in specific order and be included in the same block or it will most likely fail. Because of the gas fees I personally don't think it is worth the time and effort unless its a matter of thousands of dollars.
